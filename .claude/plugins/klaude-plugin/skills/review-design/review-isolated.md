### Workflow

Copy this checklist and check off items as you complete them:

```
Isolated Design Review Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Prepare artifacts
- [ ] Step 2: Spawn reviewers (parallel)
- [ ] Step 3: Annotate findings
- [ ] Step 4: Present report
```

---

## Step 1: Prepare Artifacts

### 1a) Read documents

Parse the invocation arguments using the same logic as standard mode Step 1:

- Extract feature name and optional scope argument
- **Argument disambiguation:** if the first argument matches a directory in `/docs/wip/`, treat it as the feature name. If it matches a scope keyword (`design`, `implementation`, `tasks`) and no such feature directory exists, treat it as the scope and prompt the user for the feature name.
- Locate `/docs/wip/[feature-name]/` directory
- If feature name is not provided or ambiguous, list `/docs/wip/` contents and ask the user

Scope resolution:

| Scope arg        | Documents to load                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| _(none)_         | `design.md` + `implementation.md` + `tasks.md` |
| `design`         | `design.md` only                               |
| `implementation` | `implementation.md` only                       |
| `tasks`          | `tasks.md` only                                |

If a requested document is missing, inform the user and proceed with available docs.

Read the in-scope documents from `/docs/wip/[feature]/`.

### 1b) Resolve pal model

Call `pal` `listmodels` to get available models. Select the most capable model (prefer latest generation with thinking/reasoning support) for the `pal codereview` call in Step 2.

### 1c) Collect context files for pal

Assemble the file list that will be passed to pal codereview via `relevant_files`. All paths must be absolute.

1. **Document files** — the absolute paths of every in-scope document from Step 1a (`design.md`, `implementation.md`, `tasks.md` as determined by scope resolution). These are the primary review targets.
2. **Related source files** — if the design docs reference specific source files (e.g., files to be created or modified), include those paths when they exist on disk. These give pal implementation context to validate the design against.

Store this list for use in Step 2 (Reviewer B).

---

## Step 2: Spawn Reviewers (Parallel)

Launch both reviewers in a **single message** so they execute in parallel.

### Reviewer A — `design-reviewer` sub-agent

Spawn using the Agent tool:

| Parameter       | Value                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| `subagent_type` | `kk:design-reviewer`      |
| `description`   | `Isolated design review`  |
| `prompt`        | See prompt template below |

**Sub-agent prompt template:**

```
You are reviewing the design documents for the "{feature_name}" feature. Apply your full review workflow.

## Feature Directory

{absolute path to /docs/wip/[feature]/}

## Documents to Review

- Design: {absolute path to design.md} (if in scope, otherwise "Not in scope")
- Implementation: {absolute path to implementation.md} (if in scope, otherwise "Not in scope")
- Tasks: {absolute path to tasks.md} (if in scope, otherwise "Not in scope")

Read the documents yourself using the Read tool. Produce your findings in the output format specified in your agent definition.
```

### Reviewer B — `pal codereview`

Follow the invocation protocol in [shared-pal-codereview-invocation.md](shared-pal-codereview-invocation.md).

**`step` parameter (step 1):** Keep lean — framing + file manifest only:

1. Framing: "The following files are design documents (markdown), not source code. Review them for technical soundness, completeness, internal consistency, and whether they provide sufficient detail for implementation. Focus on: edge cases, failure modes, missing constraints, and ambiguities that would block an implementer."
2. File manifest — categorized list of paths in `relevant_files` so pal knows each file's role (see [shared-pal-codereview-invocation.md](shared-pal-codereview-invocation.md) §`step` content for format). Categories for design review: "Documents" (the review targets) and "Related source" (existing code for context).

Do NOT inline document contents into `step`.

**`relevant_files` parameter:** Use the file list assembled in Step 1c.

**`model` parameter:** Use the model resolved in Step 1b.

### Parallel execution

Issue the pal step 1 call and the Agent tool call (Reviewer A) in the **same message** so they execute in parallel. When both return, make the pal step 2 continuation call using the `continuation_id` from step 1.

### Error handling

Handle reviewer failures inline as they occur:

- **`pal` failure** (listmodels returns no models, or codereview step 1/2 fails): Note the failure, proceed to Step 3 with design-reviewer findings only.
- **`design-reviewer` sub-agent failure** (timeout or error): Note the failure, proceed to Step 3 with pal findings only. Suggest `/kk:review-design` (standard mode) as supplement.
- **Both reviewers fail**: Abort isolated mode. Display message suggesting fallback to `/kk:review-design` (standard mode). Do not proceed to Step 3.
- **Malformed output**: Attempt best-effort parsing. If completely unparseable, treat as a failure and apply the rules above.

---

## Step 3: Annotate Findings

The main agent performs annotation — providing context, not judgment. Do NOT assign dispositions (Confirmed, Disputed, etc.). The user is the final arbiter.

### 3a) Duplicate merging

Compare findings from both reviewers by document section and issue description:

- When both flag the same logical issue: merge into one entry, tag as **"corroborated"** — independent confirmation from different models is high signal.
- Severity stays as the design-reviewer assessed it. If pal's native output implies a different level of urgency, note both perspectives side by side. Do NOT map pal's output to P0-P3 — describe the implied urgency in prose.
- If only one reviewer flagged an issue, keep it as-is with reviewer attribution.

### 3b) Author context annotations

For each finding, consider whether the design session context adds relevant information:

- If yes: add a clearly-labeled **"Author context"** annotation (e.g., "We discussed this trade-off in Step 3 and chose X because Y").
- If no: leave the finding as-is — not every finding needs an annotation.
- Annotations are context, not judgments. "We chose X because Y" is correct. "This finding is invalid" is **not**.

### 3c) Author-sourced findings

If the close re-reading during annotation triggers new observations, add them:

- Tag as **"author-sourced"** — clearly distinct from sub-agent findings.
- The user knows these come from the author and can weight accordingly.

### 3d) pal follow-up (optional)

If a pal finding is ambiguous or unclear, the main agent MAY use pal's follow-up interaction capability to clarify before presenting to the user.

### 3e) Capy index

**Capy index:** Index any confirmed `TECH_RISK` findings that reveal non-obvious architectural constraints as `kk:arch-decisions`. Index confirmed P0/P1 findings that suggest a systemic or structural design pattern (not isolated one-off issues) as `kk:review-findings`. Index on first encounter — recurrence detection happens on the search side in future reviews. This applies to findings from any source — corroborated, single-reviewer, or author-sourced.

---

## Step 4: Present Report

Use this report template, organized by agreement level:

```markdown
## Design Review Summary (Isolated Mode)

**Reviewers**: design-reviewer (Claude sub-agent), pal codereview ([model name])
**Documents reviewed**: [list]

---

### Corroborated Findings

(Both reviewers flagged — highest signal)

- **[doc:section]** Brief title ⟨corroborated⟩
  - Type: [finding_type] | Severity: P[0-3] | Confidence: [N]/10 — [reasoning]
  - **Description:** [description]
  - **Evidence:** [doc references]
  - **Recommendation:** [recommendation]
  - design-reviewer: [description in structured format]
  - pal: [description in native format]
  - Author context: [optional annotation]

### Design Reviewer Findings

(design-reviewer sub-agent only — P0-P3 format)

- **[doc:section]** Brief title
  - Type: [finding_type] | Severity: P[0-3] | Confidence: [N]/10 — [reasoning]
  - **Description:** [description]
  - **Evidence:** [doc references]
  - **Recommendation:** [recommendation]
  - Author context: [optional annotation]

### External Review Findings

(pal codereview — native format)

- [pal output in native format]
  - Author context: [optional annotation]

### Author-Sourced Findings

(Main agent observations during annotation — weight accordingly)

- **[doc:section]** Brief title ⟨author-sourced⟩
  - [description]
```

**Section rules:**

- Omit any section that has no findings (e.g., if no corroborated findings, skip that section).
- If a reviewer failed and only one reviewer's findings are present, note the failure at the top and present the available findings under the appropriate section.

### Next steps

After presenting the report, ask the user how to proceed:

```markdown
---

## Next Steps

I found X issues (corroborated: ..., design-reviewer: ..., pal: ..., author-sourced: ...).

**How would you like to proceed?**

1. **Update docs** — I'll revise the design docs to address all findings
2. **Update corroborated + high severity** — Address corroborated findings and P0/P1 issues
3. **Update specific items** — Tell me which findings to address
4. **Proceed to implementation** — Findings are acceptable, move forward
5. **No changes** — Review complete, no action needed

Please choose an option or provide specific instructions.
```

**Important:** Do NOT update any documents until the user explicitly confirms.
