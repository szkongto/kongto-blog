# Testing & Quality Assurance Process

## Conventions

- **Read capy knowledge base conventions** at [shared-capy-knowledge-protocol.md](shared-capy-knowledge-protocol.md).
- **Read profile detection** at [shared-profile-detection.md](shared-profile-detection.md). When an active profile contributes a `test/` subdirectory (e.g., `${TOOLBOX_PLUGIN_ROOT}/profiles/k8s/test/`), its `index.md` lists validators, check categories, and any binary-presence or auto-detection protocols the skill must apply. See Step 2 of the Workflow.

## Workflow

**Mandatory order — instructions before action.** The flow below is strictly sequential. Do not run any validator, test, or binary against subject-matter files until profile detection has completed and all resolved profile content is in context.

1. **Detect active profiles.** Run the `shared-profile-detection.md` procedure against the changed files.
2. **Load profile content.** For each active profile that contributes a `test/` subdirectory, load `${TOOLBOX_PLUGIN_ROOT}/profiles/<name>/test/index.md` and read its always-load + any matching conditional content. Honor the binary-presence protocols named there BEFORE any validator invocation — a missing pre-check step can crash on a tool that isn't installed.
3. **Apply the test guidelines below.** With profile methodology now loaded, run existing tests, add coverage for new or fixed functionality, and execute profile-specific validators per the loaded content.

## Guidelines

1. Always try to add tests for any new functionality, and make sure to cover all cases and code branches, according to requirements.
2. Always try to add tests for any bug-fixes, if the discovered bug is not already covered by tests. If the bug was already covered by tests, fix the existing tests as needed.
3. Always run all existing tests after you are done with a given implementation or bug-fix.
4. **Profile-aware validators.** Apply the validators and check categories the active profile's `test/index.md` specifies (loaded in Step 2 of the Workflow); honor the binary-presence protocol documented there — missing binaries should surface install hints, not shell errors.

**Capy search:** Before applying test guidelines, search `kk:test-patterns` for project-specific testing approaches and known edge cases.

Use the following guidelines when working with tests:

- Ensure comprehensive testing
- Use table-/data-driven tests and test generation
- Benchmark tests and performance regression detection
- Integration testing with test containers
- Mock generation with %LANGUAGE% best practices and well-establised %LANGUAGE% mocking tools
- Property-based testing with %LANGUAGE% best practices and well-establised %LANGUAGE% testing tools
- Propose end-to-end testing strategies if automated e2e testing is not feasible
- Code coverage analysis and reporting

**Capy index:** If a novel testing approach or tricky edge case was discovered during this session, index it as `kk:test-patterns`.
