# kk-plugin review checklist

Review checks specific to skills within the `klaude-plugin/` directory structure.

## Shared symlinks

- [ ] Do per-skill symlinks follow the pattern `shared-<name>.md` → `../_shared/<name>.md`?
- [ ] Are symlinks created from inside the consuming skill's directory?
- [ ] Do symlinks stay inside the `skills/` tree? (Cross-boundary symlinks break under some installers.)
- [ ] Are only skills that actually reference the shared file symlinked? (No blanket-symlinking.)
- [ ] Does profile content use `${TOOLBOX_PLUGIN_ROOT}` references instead of symlinks?
- [ ] Do skills and agents reference profile paths via `${TOOLBOX_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, not `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`? (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is only for `hooks.json` and MCP configs where the harness must resolve the path.)
- [ ] Do Read-only sub-agent definitions (e.g. `code-reviewer`, `profile-resolver`) receive the plugin root as an injected `## Plugin Root` value, rather than expecting to resolve `${TOOLBOX_PLUGIN_ROOT}` themselves? (They have no shell.)

## Bidirectional index invariant

- [ ] Does every markdown link in a phase `index.md` resolve to a file on disk? (Forward invariant.)
- [ ] Is every `.md` file in the phase directory (except `index.md`) referenced by at least one link in `index.md`? (Reverse invariant.)
- [ ] Are there no orphan `.md` files (authoring notes, READMEs) inside phase subdirectories? (These belong in `overview.md` at the profile root.)

## Naming conventions

- [ ] Do skill names use imperative verbs (`/kk:design`, not `/kk:analysis-process`)?
- [ ] Do grouped skills share a family prefix (`/kk:review-code`, `/kk:review-design`, `/kk:review-spec`)?
- [ ] Do agent names describe roles (`code-reviewer`), not invoking skills?
- [ ] Are other skills referenced with the `/kk:` prefix everywhere?

## Test registration and Codex generation

- [ ] Is `EXPECTED_SKILLS` in `test/test-plugin-structure.sh` updated for new skills?
- [ ] Is `EXPECTED_COMMANDS` updated for new commands?
- [ ] Is `EXPECTED_PROFILES` updated for new profiles?
- [ ] Is the **Known Profiles** list in `klaude-plugin/skills/_shared/profile-detection.md` updated for new profiles?
- [ ] Does `make generate-kodex && git diff --exit-code kodex-plugin/ .codex/agents/` show no drift?
