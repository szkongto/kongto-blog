# Go profile

## What this profile covers

Idiomatic Go source code: error handling, concurrency (goroutines, channels, context), interfaces and composition, package cohesion, the standard library, and SOLID principles expressed in Go terms (package responsibility, interface segregation, dependency inversion via interfaces).

## When it activates

Any file with a `.go` extension in scope. See [DETECTION.md](DETECTION.md) for the authoritative rule. Activation is additive with other profiles on the same diff (e.g., a repo containing both `.go` files and Kubernetes manifests activates both `go` and `k8s`).

## Populated phases

- `review-code/` — hand-written (SOLID, removal-plan) + vendored (security, code-style, naming, error-handling, performance, database, concurrency, grpc).
- `implement/` — vendored pre-write gotchas (design-patterns, structs-interfaces, error-handling, security, concurrency, context, data-structures, database, grpc, dependency-injection).
- `design/` — vendored conditional content (database, grpc, observability).
- `test/` — vendored testing guidance (testing, benchmark).
- `document/` — vendored conditional content (cli, continuous-integration).

`review-spec/` is not populated — spec conformance checking does not require Go-specific rules.

## Looking up Go dependencies

When adding or upgrading a dependency (module, SDK, framework, API), follow the `/kk:dependency-handling` skill's cascade:

1. **capy-first** — query the project's indexed `kk:lang-idioms` / `kk:project-conventions` / prior context7 fetches.
2. **context7** — fetch current docs for the Go module (`github.com/<org>/<repo>` resolves to a context7 library). Covers standard-library and common third-party packages.
3. **web** — fall back to [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev) and the module's own repository README only if the first two yield nothing.

Module metadata for the project lives in `go.mod` / `go.sum`. Version-specific behaviors should always be verified against the module version the project actually resolves to, not the latest available version.
